		Normally, Greybus Audio Data Messages are sent between the
		AP and APBridgeA using the standard USB/HSIC link between
		the AP and APBridgeA.  However, APBridgeA has its own I2S
		port and can send and receive audio data through that port.
		This option enables that feature.  Enabling this feature
		does not prevent the USB/HSIC link from being used unless
		direct audio data streaming is enabled for that CPort.

		When enabled, I2S port and Greybus Audio Data message
		configuration is done by the AP using APBridgeA's Special
		Audio Protocol.  Messages for this protocol are sent and
		received between the AP and APBridgeA using USB control
		messages.

		When active, I2S data received on APBridgeA's I2S port will
		be packetized into Greybus Audio Data Messages and sent to
		an Audio Module using the specified CPort.  Greybus Audio
		Data Messages received from an Audio Module on the specified
		CPort will be de-packetized and sent out APBridgeA's I2S port.
